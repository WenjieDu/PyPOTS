        Put all important information relative to the new model, e.g. paper link, citation number, and why you think it is necessary for PyPOTS to include.
        ❗️A rule of thumb is at least one year since publication, 10+ citations, and usefulness.

          Please note that if the model's open-source implementation is not available, it'll take much more time to finish the implementation, so we are less likely to implement it in `PyPOTS`.

        Give any and all information you think is helpful to the implementation.
        If there is open-source implementation, please provide information regarding it and the authors.
        Please mention the authors by @github-username in case you're aware of their usernames.
