class Transformer(BaseNNImputer):
    """The PyTorch implementation of the Transformer model.
    Transformer is originally proposed by Vaswani et al. in :cite:`vaswani2017Transformer`,
    and gets re-implemented as a time-series imputation model by Du et al. in :cite:`du2023SAITS`.
    Here you should refer to :cite:`du2023SAITS` for details about this Transformer imputation model.

    Parameters
    ----------
    n_steps :
        The number of time steps in the time-series data sample.

    n_features :
        The number of features in the time-series data sample.

    n_layers :
        The number of layers in the 1st and 2nd DMSA blocks in the SAITS model.

    d_model :
        The dimension of the model's backbone.
        It is the input dimension of the multi-head self-attention layers.

    d_inner :
        The dimension of the layer in the Feed-Forward Networks (FFN).

    n_heads :
        The number of heads in the multi-head self-attention mechanism.
        ``d_model`` must be divisible by ``n_heads``, and the result should be equal to ``d_k``.

    d_k :
        The dimension of the `keys` (K) and the `queries` (Q) in the DMSA mechanism.
        ``d_k`` should be the result of ``d_model`` divided by ``n_heads``. Although ``d_k`` can be directly calculated
        with given ``d_model`` and ``n_heads``, we want it be explicitly given together with ``d_v`` by users to ensure
        users be aware of them and to avoid any potential mistakes.

    d_v :
        The dimension of the `values` (V) in the DMSA mechanism.

    dropout :
        The dropout rate for all fully-connected layers in the model.

    attn_dropout :
        The dropout rate for DMSA.

    ORT_weight :
        The weight for the ORT loss.

    MIT_weight :
        The weight for the MIT loss.

    batch_size :
        The batch size for training and evaluating the model.

    epochs :
        The number of epochs for training the model.

    patience :
        The patience for the early-stopping mechanism. Given a positive integer, the training process will be
        stopped when the model does not perform better after that number of epochs.
        Leaving it default as None will disable the early-stopping.

    optimizer :
        The optimizer for model training.
        If not given, will use a default Adam optimizer.

    num_workers :
        The number of subprocesses to use for data loading.
        `0` means data loading will be in the main process, i.e. there won't be subprocesses.

    device :
        The device for the model to run on. It can be a string, a :class:`torch.device` object, or a list of them.
        If not given, will try to use CUDA devices first (will use the default CUDA device if there are multiple),
        then CPUs, considering CUDA and CPU are so far the main devices for people to train ML models.
        If given a list of devices, e.g. ['cuda:0', 'cuda:1'], or [torch.device('cuda:0'), torch.device('cuda:1')] , the
        model will be parallely trained on the multiple devices (so far only support parallel training on CUDA devices).
        Other devices like Google TPU and Apple Silicon accelerator MPS may be added in the future.

    saving_path :
        The path for automatically saving model checkpoints and tensorboard files (i.e. loss values recorded during
        training into a tensorboard file). Will not save if not given.

    model_saving_strategy :
        The strategy to save model checkpoints. It has to be one of [None, "best", "better"].
        No model will be saved when it is set as None.
        The "best" strategy will only automatically save the best model after the training finished.
        The "better" strategy will automatically save the model during training whenever the model performs
        better than in previous epochs.

    Attributes
    ----------
    model : :class:`torch.nn.Module`
        The underlying Transformer model.

    optimizer : :class:`pypots.optim.Optimizer`
        The optimizer for model training.
