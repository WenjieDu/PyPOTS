class LOCF(BaseImputer):
    """LOCF (Last Observed Carried Forward) imputation method. A naive imputation method that fills missing values
    with the last observed value. When time-series data gets inverse on the time dimension, this method can also be
    seen as NOCB (Next Observation Carried Backward). Simple but commonly used in practice.

    Parameters
    ----------
    first_step_imputation : str, default='backward'
        With LOCF, the observed values are carried forward to impute the missing ones. But if the first value
        is missing, there is no value to carry forward. This parameter is used to determine the strategy to
        impute the missing values at the beginning of the time-series sequence after LOCF is applied.
        It can be one of ['backward', 'zero', 'median', 'nan'].
        If 'nan', the missing values at the sequence beginning will be left as NaNs.
        If 'zero', the missing values at the sequence beginning will be imputed with 0.
        If 'backward', the missing values at the beginning of the time-series sequence will be imputed with the
        first observed value in the sequence, i.e. the first observed value will be carried backward to impute
        the missing values at the beginning of the sequence. This method is also known as NOCB (Next Observation
        Carried Backward). If 'median', the missing values at the sequence beginning will be imputed with the overall
        median values of features in the dataset.
        If `first_step_imputation` is not "nan", if missing values still exist (this is usually caused by whole feature
        missing) after applying `first_step_imputation`, they will be filled with 0.
