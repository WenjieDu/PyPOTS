        Notes
        -----
        The processing functions of train/val/test stages are separated for the situation that the input of
        the three stages are different, and this situation usually happens when the Dataset/Dataloader classes
        used in the train/val/test stages are not the same, e.g. the training data and validating data in a
        classification task contains labels, but the testing data (from the production environment) generally
        doesn't have labels.
