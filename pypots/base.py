class BaseModel(ABC):
    """The base model class for all model implementations.

    Parameters
    ----------
    device :
        The device for the model to run on. It can be a string, a :class:`torch.device` object, or a list of them.
        If not given, will try to use CUDA devices first (will use the default CUDA device if there are multiple),
        then CPUs, considering CUDA and CPU are so far the main devices for people to train ML models.
        If given a list of devices, e.g. ['cuda:0', 'cuda:1'], or [torch.device('cuda:0'), torch.device('cuda:1')] , the
        model will be parallely trained on the multiple devices (so far only support parallel training on CUDA devices).
        Other devices like Google TPU and Apple Silicon accelerator MPS may be added in the future.

    saving_path :
        The path for automatically saving model checkpoints and tensorboard files (i.e. loss values recorded during
        training into a tensorboard file). Will not save if not given.

    model_saving_strategy :
        The strategy to save model checkpoints. It has to be one of [None, "best", "better", "all"].
        No model will be saved when it is set as None.
        The "best" strategy will only automatically save the best model after the training finished.
        The "better" strategy will automatically save the model during training whenever the model performs
        better than in previous epochs.
        The "all" strategy will save every model after each epoch training.

    verbose :
        Whether to print out the training logs during the training process.

    Attributes
    ----------
    model : object, default = None
        The underlying model or algorithm to finish the task.

    summary_writer : None or torch.utils.tensorboard.SummaryWriter,  default = None,
        The event writer to save training logs. Default as None. It only works when parameter `tb_file_saving_path` is
        given, otherwise the training events won't be saved.

        It is designed as being set up while initializing the model because it's created to
        1). help visualize the model's training procedure (during training not after) and
        2). assist users to tune the model's hype-parameters.
        If only setting it up after training with a function like setter(), it cannot achieve the 1st purpose.

        `0` means data loading will be in the main process, i.e. there won't be subprocesses.

    device :
        The device for the model to run on. It can be a string, a :class:`torch.device` object, or a list of them.
        If not given, will try to use CUDA devices first (will use the default CUDA device if there are multiple),
        then CPUs, considering CUDA and CPU are so far the main devices for people to train ML models.
        If given a list of devices, e.g. ['cuda:0', 'cuda:1'], or [torch.device('cuda:0'), torch.device('cuda:1')] , the
        model will be parallely trained on the multiple devices (so far only support parallel training on CUDA devices).
        Other devices like Google TPU and Apple Silicon accelerator MPS may be added in the future.

    saving_path :
        The path for automatically saving model checkpoints and tensorboard files (i.e. loss values recorded during
        training into a tensorboard file). Will not save if not given.

    model_saving_strategy :
        The strategy to save model checkpoints. It has to be one of [None, "best", "better", "all"].
        No model will be saved when it is set as None.
        The "best" strategy will only automatically save the best model after the training finished.
        The "better" strategy will automatically save the model during training whenever the model performs
        better than in previous epochs.
        The "all" strategy will save every model after each epoch training.

    verbose :
        Whether to print out the training logs during the training process.

    Attributes
    ---------
    best_model_dict : dict, default = None,
        A dictionary contains the trained model that achieves the best performance according to the loss defined,
        i.e. the lowest loss.

    best_loss : float, default = inf,
        The criteria to judge whether the model's performance is the best so far.
        Usually the lower, the better.

    best_epoch : int, default = -1,
        The epoch number when the best loss is got.

    Notes
    -----
    Optimizers are necessary for training deep-learning neural networks, but we don't put a parameter ``optimizer``
    here because some models (e.g. GANs) need more than one optimizer (e.g. one for generator, one for discriminator),
    and ``optimizer`` is ambiguous for them. Therefore, we leave optimizers as parameters for concrete model
    implementations, and you can pass any number of optimizers to your model when implementing it,
    :class:`pypots.clustering.crli.CRLI` for example.
