    For most of the NN models (inheriting BaseNNModel) in PyPOTS, their model core inherits this class and
    implement the forward and calc_criterion methods, and they exempt from overwriting _train_model() which
    carries concrete model training details, e.g. SAITS, Transformer, and this is task agnostic.
    But some models' processing procedures are too complex to be abstracted into this class, e.g. GAN models
    (like US-GAN and CRLI) which have more than one optimizer need to update or VaDER which needs pretraining and
    has complicated manipulations for its Gaussian mixture model, their model core don't have to inherit this class,
    just be a subclass of torch.nn.Module and obey basic rules (include the `loss`/`metric` as keys in the return dict)
    to be compatible with PyPOTS. Additionally, in this case, they need to overwrite _train_model() to implement
    their own training procedures.
