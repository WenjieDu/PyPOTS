=======================

Citing PyPOTS
^^^^^^^^^^^^^
**[Updates in Jun 2023]** üéâA short version of the PyPOTS paper is accepted by the 9th SIGKDD international workshop on
Mining and Learning from Time Series (`MiLeTS'23 <https://kdd-milets.github.io/milets2023/>`_).
Besides, PyPOTS has been included as a `PyTorch Ecosystem <https://landscape.pytorch.org/?item=modeling--specialized--pypots>`_ project.

PyPOTS paper is available on arXiv at `this URL <https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.18811>`_.,
and we are pursuing to publish it in prestigious academic venues, e.g. JMLR (track for
`Machine Learning Open Source Software <https://www.jmlr.org/mloss/>`_). If you use PyPOTS in your work,
