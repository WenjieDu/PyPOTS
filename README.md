‚¶ø `Motivation`: Due to all kinds of reasons like failure of collection sensors, communication error,
and unexpected malfunction, missing values are common to see in time series from the real-world environment.
This makes partially-observed time series (POTS) a pervasive problem in open-world modeling and prevents advanced
data analysis. Although this problem is important, the area of machine learning on POTS still lacks a dedicated toolkit.
PyPOTS is created to fill in this blank.

‚¶ø `Mission`: PyPOTS (pronounced "Pie Pots") is born to become a handy toolbox that is going to make machine learning on
POTS easy rather than tedious, to help engineers and researchers focus more on the core problems in their hands rather
than on how to deal with the missing parts in their data. PyPOTS will keep integrating classical and the latest
state-of-the-art machine learning algorithms for partially-observed multivariate time series. For sure, besides various
algorithms, PyPOTS is going to have unified APIs together with detailed documentation and interactive examples across
algorithms as tutorials.

ü§ó **Please** star this repo to help others notice PyPOTS if you think it is a useful toolkit.
**Please** kindly [cite PyPOTS](https://github.com/WenjieDu/PyPOTS#-citing-pypots) in your publications if it helps with
your research.
This really means a lot to our open-source research. Thank you!

## ‚ùñ Available Algorithms

PyPOTS supports imputation, classification, clustering, forecasting, and anomaly detection tasks on multivariate
partially-observed time series with missing values. The table below shows the availability of each algorithm
(sorted by Year) in PyPOTS for different tasks. The symbol `‚úÖ` indicates the algorithm is available for the
corresponding task (note that models will be continuously updated in the future to handle tasks that are not
currently supported. Stay tuned‚ùóÔ∏è).

üåü Since **v0.2**, all neural-network models in PyPOTS has got hyperparameter-optimization support.
This functionality is implemented with the [Microsoft NNI](https://github.com/microsoft/nni) framework. You may want to
refer to our time-series imputation survey and benchmark repo [Awesome_Imputation](https://github.com/WenjieDu/Awesome_Imputation)
to see how to config and tune the hyperparameters.

üî• Note that all models whose name with `üßë‚Äçüîß` in the table (e.g. Transformer, iTransformer, Informer etc.) are not
originally proposed as algorithms for POTS data in their papers, and they cannot directly accept time series with
missing values as input, let alone imputation. **To make them applicable to POTS data, we specifically apply the
embedding strategy and training approach (ORT+MIT) the same as we did in
[the SAITS paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2202.08516)[^1].**

The task types are abbreviated as follows:
**`IMPU`**: Imputation;
**`FORE`**: Forecasting;
**`CLAS`**: Classification;
**`CLUS`**: Clustering;
**`ANOD`**: Anomaly Detection.
The paper references and links are all listed at the bottom of this file.

üôã Differences between `LLM (Large Language Model)` and `TSFM (Time-Series Foundation Model)` in the above table:
`LLM` refers to the models that are pre-trained on large-scale text data and can be fine-tuned for specific tasks.
`TSFM` refers to the models that are pre-trained on large-scale time series data, inspired by recent achievements 
of foundation models in CV and NLP. 

üíØ Contribute your model right now to increase your research impact! PyPOTS downloads are increasing rapidly
(**[600K+ in total and 1K+ daily on PyPI so far](https://www.pepy.tech/projects/pypots)**),
and your work will be widely used and cited by the community.
Refer to the [contribution guide](https://github.com/WenjieDu/PyPOTS#-contribution) to see how to include your model in
PyPOTS.

## ‚ùñ PyPOTS Ecosystem

At PyPOTS, things are related to coffee, which we're familiar with. Yes, this is a coffee universe!
As you can see, there is a coffee pot in the PyPOTS logo. And what else? Please read on ;-)

<a href="https://github.com/WenjieDu/TSDB">
    <img src="https://pypots.com/figs/pypots_logos/TSDB/logo_FFBG.svg" align="left" width="140" alt="TSDB logo"/>
</a>

üëà Time series datasets are taken as coffee beans at PyPOTS, and POTS datasets are incomplete coffee beans with missing
parts that have their own meanings. To make various public time-series datasets readily available to users,
<i>Time Series Data Beans (TSDB)</i> is created to make loading time-series datasets super easy!
Visit [TSDB](https://github.com/WenjieDu/TSDB) right now to know more about this handy tool üõ†, and it now supports a
total of 172 open-source datasets!

<a href="https://github.com/WenjieDu/PyGrinder">
    <img src="https://pypots.com/figs/pypots_logos/PyGrinder/logo_FFBG.svg" align="right" width="140" alt="PyGrinder logo"/>
</a>

üëâ To simulate the real-world data beans with missingness, the ecosystem library
[PyGrinder](https://github.com/WenjieDu/PyGrinder), a toolkit helping grind your coffee beans into incomplete ones, is
created. Missing patterns fall into three categories according to Robin's theory[^13]:
MCAR (missing completely at random), MAR (missing at random), and MNAR (missing not at random).
PyGrinder supports all of them and additional functionalities related to missingness.
With PyGrinder, you can introduce synthetic missing values into your datasets with a single line of code.

<a href="https://github.com/WenjieDu/BenchPOTS">
    <img src="https://pypots.com/figs/pypots_logos/BenchPOTS/logo_FFBG.svg" align="left" width="140" alt="BenchPOTS logo"/>
</a>

üëà To fairly evaluate the performance of PyPOTS algorithms, the benchmarking suite
[BenchPOTS](https://github.com/WenjieDu/BenchPOTS) is created, which provides standard and unified data-preprocessing
pipelines to prepare datasets for measuring the performance of different POTS algorithms on various tasks.

<a href="https://github.com/WenjieDu/BrewPOTS">
    <img src="https://pypots.com/figs/pypots_logos/BrewPOTS/logo_FFBG.svg" align="right" width="140" alt="BrewPOTS logo"/>
</a>

üëâ Now the beans, grinder, and pot are ready, please have a seat on the bench and let's think about how to brew us a cup
of coffee. Tutorials are necessary! Considering the future workload, PyPOTS tutorials are released in a single repo,
and you can find them in [BrewPOTS](https://github.com/WenjieDu/BrewPOTS).
Take a look at it now, and learn how to brew your POTS datasets!

## ‚ùñ Installation

You can refer to [the installation instruction](https://docs.pypots.com/en/latest/install.html) in PyPOTS documentation
for a guideline with more details.

PyPOTS is available on both [PyPI](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/pypots)
and [Anaconda](https://anaconda.org/conda-forge/pypots).
You can install PyPOTS like below as well as
[TSDB](https://github.com/WenjieDu/TSDB),[PyGrinder](https://github.com/WenjieDu/PyGrinder),
[BenchPOTS](https://github.com/WenjieDu/BenchPOTS), and [AI4TS](https://github.com/WenjieDu/AI4TS):

``` bash
# via pip
pip install pypots            # the first time installation
pip install pypots --upgrade  # update pypots to the latest version
# install from the latest source code with the latest features but may be not officially released yet
pip install https://github.com/WenjieDu/PyPOTS/archive/main.zip

# via conda
conda install conda-forge::pypots  # the first time installation
conda update  conda-forge::pypots  # update pypots to the latest version
```

## ‚ùñ Usage

``` python
# Data preprocessing. Tedious, but PyPOTS can help.
import numpy as np
from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler
from pygrinder import mcar
from pypots.data import load_specific_dataset
data = load_specific_dataset('physionet_2012')  # PyPOTS will automatically download and extract it.
X = data['X']
num_samples = len(X['RecordID'].unique())
